The NIT Patna Staff Issue Resolution project is a web application designed to address the problems faced by staff members in various departments. Built using basic frontend technologies and AppScript, the project provides a platform for staff members to report their issues and seek resolutions. 
Staff can submit their complaints through the application, which then captures the relevant details and forwards them to the respective departments for prompt action. This streamlined process ensures efficient problem resolution and improves communication between staff and departments, leading to a better working environment at NIT Patna.
